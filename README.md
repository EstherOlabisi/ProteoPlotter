* To run the Shiny R script, open the script in RStudio and click the "Run App" button at the top right corner of the editor.
* It is preferable to select the external (browser) option from the "Run App" drop-down list but you could also try the app in an RStudio Window.
* For test input files: 
  * prot_frm_perseus.txt is the "Protein Groups" file
  * 1d annot.txt is the "1D annotation" file
  * curve_matrix.txt is the "Volcano threshold lines" file
